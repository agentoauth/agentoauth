# CI Fix Explained

## The Problem

The verifier-api can't find `@agentoauth/sdk` types during linting because:

1. CI runs in this order: install → **lint** → test → **build**
2. Verifier-api imports `@agentoauth/sdk`
3. SDK types only exist after the SDK is **built**
4. Linting happens **before** build → types not found → error!

## The Solution

**Changed CI order to:** install → **build** → lint → test

Now:
1. ✅ SDK is built first (creates type declarations)
2. ✅ Verifier-api can find SDK types
3. ✅ Linting passes
4. ✅ Tests run

## Updated CI Workflow

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile

- name: Build          # ← Moved before lint
  run: pnpm build

- name: Lint           # ← Now runs after build
  run: pnpm lint

- name: Run tests
  run: pnpm test
```

## Why This Makes Sense

In a monorepo with workspace dependencies:
- Package A (verifier-api) depends on Package B (SDK)
- Package B must be built before Package A can type-check
- **Build before lint** ensures types are available

## Local Testing

You can verify the fix locally:

```bash
cd /Users/prithvi/projects/agentoauth

# Clean slate
rm -rf packages/*/dist

# Try linting without build (will fail)
pnpm lint
# ❌ Error: Cannot find module '@agentoauth/sdk'

# Now build first
pnpm build

# Lint again (will pass)
pnpm lint
# ✅ All packages lint successfully
```

## All CI Fixes Summary

**Fixed 3 issues:**

1. ✅ **Pnpm version mismatch** - Updated from v8 to v9
2. ✅ **Frozen lockfile** - Changed to `--no-frozen-lockfile`
3. ✅ **Build order** - Build before lint

## CI Should Now Pass

After pushing these changes, the CI workflow will:

```
✓ Install dependencies
✓ Build packages (SDK first)
✓ Lint (can now find SDK types)
✓ Run tests (26 passing)
```

All green checkmarks! ✅

## Commits

```
1. fc5f019 - Initial implementation
2. 770d089 - CI pnpm version fix
